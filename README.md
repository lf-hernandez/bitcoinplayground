# Bitcoin Playground

[![Go CI](https://github.com/lf-hernandez/bitcoinplayground/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lf-hernandez/bitcoinplayground/actions/workflows/go.yml)

The purpose of this repo is to test assumptions and further understanding of Bitcoin/Blockchain. You can run simulations to generate Merkle Trees and assert membership via Merkle Proofs, similarly for generating a basic communal ledger with ECDSA signing.

## Installation

Bitcoin Playground has no runtime dependencies. You can just [download](https://github.com/lf-hernandez/bitcoinplayground/releases/tag/0.1.0) the binary and run it.

Alternatively, if you have a working Go environment: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lf-hernandez/bitcoinplayground
cd bitcoinplayground
make
```
